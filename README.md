# SQL Joins
## Springboard Instructions

## **Part One: Getting Started**

Let’s start with the following sql file called ***data.sql***.

Download the starter code, and first, take a look at the SQL in that file and make sure you understand what it is doing. Once you have read that code, run the following in the unzipped folder:

```bash
$ psql < data.sql
$ psql joins_exercise
```

Write the following SQL commands to produce the necessary output

- Join the two tables so that every column and record appears, regardless of if there is not an ***owner_id*** .

- Count the number of cars for each owner. Display the owners first_name , last_name and count of vehicles. The first_name should be ordered in ascending order.

- Count the number of cars for each owner and display the average price for each of the cars as integers. Display the owners first_name , last_name, average price and count of vehicles. The first_name should be ordered in descending order. Only display results with more than one vehicle and an average price greater than 10000. Your output should look like this:
